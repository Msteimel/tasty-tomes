# Permissions and Roles Implementation Guide

## Overview
This document outlines the role-based permission system for the Tasty Tomes cookbook application, what has been implemented, and what remains to be done for a complete MVP.

## Role Definitions

### Owner
- **Full Access**: Can manage all aspects of the cookbook
- Can edit cookbook settings (name, description, cover image, tags, privacy)
- Can manage members (add, remove, change roles, including promoting to admin/owner)

- Can create, edit, and delete recipes
- Can create, edit, and delete variants
- Can delete other members' contributions in their cookbook
- **Can delete the cookbook entirely**
- Can transfer ownership to another member

### Admin
- **Nearly Full Access**: Same as Owner except cannot delete the cookbook
- Can edit cookbook settings (name, description, cover image, tags, privacy)
- Can manage members (add, remove, change roles for non-owners)
- **Cannot**: Change owner roles, promote members to owner, or delete the cookbook
- Can add/remove recipes to/from cookbook
- Can create, edit, and delete recipes

- Can view all recipes in the cookbook
- Can add personal notes to any recipe
- Can edit/delete their own notes
- **Cannot**: Create recipes, edit recipes, create variants, or change cookbook settings

### Viewer
- **Read-Only Access**: Can only view content
- Can view all recipes in the cookbook
- Can view variants
- **Cannot**: Create, edit, delete, or add notes to anything

## What Has Been Implemented

### ‚úÖ Core Infrastructure
1. **Permission Utility (`/src/lib/permissions.ts`)**
   - Centralized permission logic for all actions
   - Functions for checking roles and capabilities:
     - `getUserRole()` - Get user's role in a cookbook
     - `isOwner()`, `isAdminOrOwner()`, `isEditorOrOwner()`, `hasElevatedRole()`, `isMember()`
     - `canViewCookbook()` - Check public/private access
     - `canEditCookbookSettings()` - Owner & Admin settings access
     - `canDeleteCookbook()` - Owner-only cookbook deletion
     - `canManageMembers()` - Member management permissions (Owner & Admin)
     - `canManageRecipesInCookbook()` - Add/remove recipes (Owner, Admin, Editor in collaborative)
     - `canCreateRecipe()` - Create new recipes (Owner, Admin, Editor in collaborative)
     - `canEditRecipe()` - Edit existing recipes
     - `canDeleteRecipe()` - Delete recipes (Owner, Admin, Creator)
     - `canCreateVariant()`, `canEditVariant()`, `canDeleteVariant()`
     - `canAddNotes()` - Add notes to recipes (Contributor and above)
   - Helper functions:
     - `getRoleDescription()` - User-friendly role descriptions for all 5 roles
     - `getRoleBadgeColor()` - UI styling for role badges (5 different colors)
     - `canRemoveMember()` - Prevent removing last owner
     - `canChangeMemberRole()` - Permission checks for role changes (admins can't promote to owner)

### ‚úÖ Member Management
1. **Dedicated Members Page (`/src/app/(cookbook)/cookbook/[id]/members/page.tsx`)**
   - Owner and Admin access to manage cookbook members
   - Invite new members with email
   - Assign roles (Owner, Admin, Editor, Contributor, Viewer)
   - Change member roles with proper permission checks:
     - Owners can change any role
     - Admins can change any role except Owner (cannot promote to Owner or demote Owners)
   - Remove members (with protection for last owner)
   - Transfer ownership capability (owners only, becomes admin after transfer)
   - Role permission descriptions for all 5 roles
   - Members grouped by role (Owners, Admins, Editors, Contributors, Viewers)
   - Visual distinction with color-coded badges

2. **Members Display on Cookbook Page**
   - Shows all cookbook members with role badges
   - Link to member management (for owners only)
   - Role indicators with color coding

### ‚úÖ Permission Enforcement
1. **Cookbook Detail Page** (`/src/app/(cookbook)/cookbook/[id]/page.tsx`)
   - Conditional rendering based on permissions:
     - "Edit Cookbook" button (owners and admins only)
     - "Add New Recipe" button (owners, admins, and editors in collaborative cookbooks)
     - "Manage Recipes" button (owners, admins, and editors with manage rights)
     - "Manage Members" button (owners and admins only)
   - Displays user's current role with color-coded badge
   - Shows member count and list with all roles

2. **Cookbook Edit Page** (`/src/app/(cookbook)/cookbook/[id]/edit/page.tsx`)
   - Owner and Admin access to edit cookbook settings
   - Prevents non-owners/admins from accessing
   - ‚úÖ Cookbook deletion only accessible to Owners (triple confirmation required)
   - Uses `canDeleteCookbook()` permission check
   - "Danger Zone" section only visible to owners

3. **Manage Recipes Page** (`/src/app/(cookbook)/cookbook/[id]/manage/page.tsx`)
   - Added permission check using `canManageRecipesInCookbook()`
   - Redirects unauthorized users

4. **Recipe Edit Page** (`/src/app/(cookbook)/recipes/[id]/edit/page.tsx`)
   - Updated to use `canEditRecipe()` permission utility
   - Checks both creator and cookbook context (when implemented)

## Implementation Checklist for MVP

To complete the MVP, focus on these tasks in order:

### Phase 1: Cookbook Delete Restriction ‚úÖ COMPLETE
- [x] Update cookbook edit page with `canDeleteCookbook()` check
- [x] Show delete button only to owners
- [x] Test admin cannot delete cookbook
- [x] Add triple confirmation for safety (2 confirms + type "DELETE")

### Phase 2: Note System for Contributors ‚úÖ COMPLETE
- [x] Update `RecipeNotesWithAdd` component to check `canAddNotes()` permission
- [x] Add `cookbook` and `currentUserId` props to component
- [x] Update `AddNoteForm` to accept and use current user's info
- [x] Add `username` field to `CookbookMember` type
- [x] Update dummy data with usernames for all members
- [x] Implement permission-based "Add Your Note" button display
- [x] Notes now properly track author via userId and username

**Note**: Full authentication system needed for production to get real user IDs

### Phase 3: Recipe Context (Critical) ‚úÖ COMPLETE
- [x] Add `cookbookIds?: string[]` to Recipe type (array-based for multiple cookbooks)

- [ ] Add permission checks to variant editing
   - [ ] Update variant display to show creator

### Phase 6: Cookbook List & Discovery
- [ ] Filter cookbooks by visibility and membership
- [ ] Add role indicators to cookbook cards
   - [ ] Show permission status

### Phase 7: Testing & Polish
- [ ] Test all permission combinations
- [ ] Add error messages for unauthorized actions
- [ ] Add loading states
- [ ] Add permission tooltips

## Key Files Reference

- **Types**: `/src/lib/types.ts` - Data models
- **Permissions**: `/src/lib/permissions.ts` - Permission logic
- **Dummy Data**: `/src/lib/dummyData.ts` - Test data with members

### Pages to Update
- Recipe detail: `/src/app/(cookbook)/recipes/[id]/page.tsx`
- Variant create: `/src/app/(cookbook)/recipes/[id]/variant/page.tsx`
- Variant edit: `/src/app/(cookbook)/recipes/[id]/variant/[variantId]/edit/page.tsx`
- Cookbook list: `/src/app/(cookbook)/cookbook/page.tsx`
- Profile: `/src/app/(user-profiles)/profile/page.tsx`

## Testing Strategy

### Test Scenarios
1. **Owner**:
   - Can access all management pages
   - Can edit all settings
   - Can manage all members (including promoting to owner)
   - Can add/edit/delete all recipes
   - Can delete the cookbook

2. **Admin**:
   - Can access management pages
   - Can edit cookbook settings
   - Can manage members (except cannot change/remove owners or promote to owner)
   - Can add/edit/delete all recipes
   - Cannot delete the cookbook

3. **Editor in Collaborative Cookbook**:
   - Can create recipes
   - Can edit own recipes
   - Can edit others' recipes
   - Cannot change cookbook settings
   - Cannot manage members

4. **Editor in Non-Collaborative Cookbook**:
   - Cannot create recipes
   - Can only edit own recipes
   - Cannot edit others' recipes

5. **Contributor**:
   - Can view all recipes
   - Can add notes to recipes
   - Can edit/delete own notes
   - Cannot create or edit recipes
   - Cannot create variants

6. **Viewer**:
   - Can only view recipes
   - All edit buttons hidden
   - Cannot add notes
   - Redirected from management pages

7. **Non-Member**:
   - Can view public cookbooks
   - Cannot view private cookbooks
   - Cannot perform any actions

## Notes for Database Implementation

When moving from dummy data to a real database:

1. **User Authentication**: Replace `"Current User"` with actual user IDs from auth system
2. **Member Lookups**: Use email‚Üíuser ID resolution for invitations
3. **Cascade Deletes**: Handle recipe deletion when members leave
4. **Indexes**: Add indexes on `cookbookId`, `createdBy`, `userId` for performance
5. **Transactions**: Wrap member/recipe changes in transactions
6. **Validation**: Add server-side permission validation (don't trust client)

## Security Considerations

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: Current implementation is client-side only. Before production:

1. Add server-side permission checks on all API routes
2. Validate user permissions on database operations
3. Use proper authentication (replace `"Current User"`)
4. Add rate limiting for invitations
5. Validate email addresses server-side
6. Implement CSRF protection
7. Add audit logging for permission changes

## Summary

**What's Complete**:
- ‚úÖ Permission utility system
- ‚úÖ Member management UI
- ‚úÖ Basic permission enforcement on cookbook pages
- ‚úÖ Role-based UI rendering

**What's Missing**:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Recipe-cookbook association
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Variant permission checks
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Recipe view page permissions
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Cookbook list filtering
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Complete testing of all permission scenarios

With the infrastructure in place, implementing the remaining features should be straightforward - mostly connecting the existing permission functions to the UI components.
