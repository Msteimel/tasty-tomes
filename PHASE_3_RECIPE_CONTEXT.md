# Phase 3: Recipe Context - Implementation Complete ✅

## Overview
This phase establishes the critical link between recipes and cookbooks, enabling proper permission checks and cookbook-aware recipe management. **Recipes can be associated with multiple cookbooks** using an array-based approach.

## Changes Made

### 1. Type System Updates

#### `/src/lib/types.ts`
- **Added** `cookbookIds?: string[]` to `Recipe` interface
  - Purpose: Store ALL cookbook associations for a recipe
  - **Array-based**: A recipe can belong to multiple cookbooks
  - Optional field: recipes can exist independently or within cookbook context
  - Enables permission checks based on cookbook membership

```typescript
export interface Recipe {
  id: string;
  recipeName: string;
  // ... other fields ...
  createdBy: string;
  cookbookIds?: string[]; // ← NEW: Array of cookbook associations
  recipeImage?: string;
  // ... rest of fields ...
}
```

### 2. Data Updates

#### `/src/lib/dummyData.ts`
Updated all 8 dummy recipes with cookbook associations (array-based):

| Recipe ID | Recipe Name | cookbookIds | Cookbooks |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|-----------|
| 1 | Classic Spaghetti Carbonara | ["1", "2"] | Family Favorites, International Cuisine |
| 2 | Chocolate Chip Cookies | ["1"] | Family Favorites |
| 3 | Thai Green Curry | ["2", "4"] | International Cuisine, Quick Weeknight Dinners |
| 4 | French Onion Soup | ["2", "3"] | International Cuisine, Comfort Food Classics |
| 5 | Chicken Tikka Masala | ["2"] | International Cuisine |
| 6 | Homemade Mac and Cheese | ["1", "3"] | Family Favorites, Comfort Food Classics |
| 7 | Korean Beef Bulgogi | ["2", "4"] | International Cuisine, Quick Weeknight Dinners |
| 8 | Lemon Bars | ["1"] | Family Favorites |

**Key Feature**: Recipes can belong to multiple cookbooks, demonstrating the many-to-many relationship.

### 3. Navigation Updates

#### `/src/app/(cookbook)/cookbook/[id]/page.tsx`
**Updated "Add New Recipe" Button:**

```typescript
// Before:
<LinkAsButton href="/recipes/create" variant="default">
  Add New Recipe
</LinkAsButton>

// After:
<LinkAsButton href={`/recipes/create?cookbookId=${cookbook.id}`} variant="default">
  Add New Recipe
</LinkAsButton>
```

**Result**: Cookbook ID is passed as query parameter when creating recipes from cookbook pages.

### 4. Recipe Creation Flow

#### `/src/app/(cookbook)/recipes/create/page.tsx`

**New Imports:**
- Added `useSearchParams` hook to read URL parameters

**Updated Type Definition:**
```typescript
type RecipeFormData = Omit<
  Recipe,
  "id" | "createdAt" | "updatedAt" | "createdBy" | "recipeImage" | "cookbookIds"
> & {
  recipeImage?: File;
  cookbookIds?: string[]; // ← Array of cookbook IDs
};
```

**Reading Cookbook Context:**
```typescript
const searchParams = useSearchParams();
const cookbookIdFromUrl = searchParams.get("cookbookId");

// Get cookbook details to show name in banner
const cookbook = cookbookIdFromUrl ? getCookbookById(cookbookIdFromUrl) : null;
```

**Form State Initialization:**
```typescript
const [formData, setFormData] = useState({
  recipeName: "",
  recipeDescription: "",
  // ... other fields ...
  cookbookIds: cookbookIdFromUrl ? [cookbookIdFromUrl] : undefined, // ← Initialize as array
});
```

**Recipe Creation:**
```typescript
const newRecipe: Recipe = {
  id: generateId(),
  // ... other fields ...
  createdBy: currentUser,
  cookbookIds: formData.cookbookIds, // ← Include as array
  // ... rest of fields ...
};
```

**Visual Feedback (Enhanced):**
Added info banner showing the specific cookbook name:

```tsx
{cookbook && (
  <div className="mb-4 p-3 bg-blue-50 border border-blue-200 rounded-md">
    <p className="text-sm text-blue-800">
      ℹ️ This recipe will be associated with <strong>"{cookbook.name}"</strong>
    </p>
  </div>
)}
```

## How It Works

### User Flow

1. **From Cookbook Page:**
   - User views a cookbook (e.g., "Family Favorites")
   - Clicks "Add New Recipe" button (only visible if permitted)
   - Redirected to `/recipes/create?cookbookId=1`

2. **On Recipe Creation Page:**
   - Blue info banner appears: "This recipe will be associated with your cookbook"
   - Form loads with `cookbookId` pre-set to "1"
   - User fills out recipe details

3. **On Submit:**
   - New recipe created with `cookbookId: "1"`
   - Recipe is now associated with "Family Favorites" cookbook
   - Enables cookbook-aware permission checks

### Permission Integration

With `cookbookIds` available, permission checks can now work with multiple cookbooks:

```typescript
// Example: Check if user can edit a recipe in any associated cookbook
const canEdit = recipe.cookbookIds?.some(cookbookId => {
  const cookbook = getCookbookById(cookbookId);
  return cookbook && canEditRecipe(cookbook, currentUserId, recipe.createdBy);
}) || recipe.createdBy === currentUserId; // Fallback for recipes without cookbooks
```

## Benefits

### 1. **Proper Permission Enforcement**
- Recipe edit/delete permissions check ALL associated cookbooks
- Collaborative cookbook features work correctly
- Owner/Admin privileges apply across all cookbook associations

### 2. **Context Awareness**
- Recipes "know" ALL cookbooks they belong to
- Can display "appears in X cookbooks"
- Can filter recipes by cookbook

### 3. **User Experience**
- **Clear indication with cookbook name** when creating recipe in cookbook context
- Seamless workflow from cookbook → create recipe
- Recipe automatically associated without manual selection

### 4. **Data Integrity**
- **Many-to-many relationship**: Recipe can be in multiple cookbooks
- Maintains all relationships between recipes and cookbooks
- Enables complex operations (e.g., remove from one cookbook but keep in others)
- Supports analytics (e.g., "most popular recipes across cookbooks")

## What This Enables

### Now Possible:

✅ **Recipe Permission Checks**
- Check if user has permission to edit recipe via cookbook membership
- Enforce collaborative vs. non-collaborative cookbook rules
- Allow cookbook owners/admins to manage all cookbook recipes

✅ **Recipe Filtering**
- Show all recipes in a specific cookbook
- Filter user's recipes by cookbook
- Search within cookbook recipes

✅ **Cookbook Management**
- Know which recipes belong to which cookbooks
- Display recipe count accurately
- Handle recipe removal from cookbook

### Still To Implement (Later Phases):

- [ ] Update recipe view page to use cookbook context for permissions (Phase 4)
- [ ] Update recipe edit page to check cookbook permissions (Phase 4)
- [ ] Show cookbook breadcrumb on recipe pages
- [ ] Allow recipe to be added to multiple cookbooks
- [ ] Handle recipe orphaning when removed from all cookbooks

## Testing Scenarios

### Test Case 1: Create Recipe from Cookbook
1. Navigate to cookbook detail page (e.g., "Family Favorites")
2. Click "Add New Recipe" (requires Contributor+ role)
3. Verify URL includes `?cookbookId=1`
4. **Verify blue info banner shows: "This recipe will be associated with 'Family Favorites'"**
5. Submit recipe
6. Verify `recipe.cookbookIds` contains `["1"]`

### Test Case 2: Create Recipe Independently
1. Navigate to `/recipes/create` directly (no query params)
2. Verify no info banner appears
3. Submit recipe
4. Verify `recipe.cookbookIds` is undefined

### Test Case 3: Recipe in Multiple Cookbooks
1. View recipe #1 (Spaghetti Carbonara)
2. Verify it appears in both "Family Favorites" and "International Cuisine"
3. Check `recipe.cookbookIds` contains `["1", "2"]`
4. Verify user can edit if they have permission in EITHER cookbook

### Test Case 3: Permission Enforcement
1. User with Viewer role views cookbook
2. Verify "Add New Recipe" button is hidden
3. Cannot access `/recipes/create?cookbookId=X` (should be enforced server-side)

## Future Enhancements

### For Production:
- [ ] Server-side validation of cookbook permissions before recipe creation
- [ ] Verify user has `canCreateRecipe` permission for the cookbook
- [ ] Add recipe to cookbook's recipe array automatically
- [ ] Send notifications to cookbook members about new recipe
- [ ] Handle cookbookIds in recipe edit flow
- [ ] **Add UI to add/remove recipe from additional cookbooks**
- [ ] **Show all associated cookbooks on recipe detail page**

### For Enhanced UX:
- [x] Show cookbook name in banner instead of generic message
- [ ] Add breadcrumb: Cookbook > Create Recipe
- [ ] Option to "Create recipe without associating to cookbook"
- [ ] **Multi-select: "Also add to these cookbooks"**
- [ ] Suggest recipes to add to cookbook (if creating independently)
- [ ] **Badge showing "In X cookbooks" on recipe cards**

## Related Files

**Updated:**
- `/src/lib/types.ts` - Added cookbookId to Recipe type

- Permission utility functions - Use cookbook context when available
